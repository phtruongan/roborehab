### Install dependencies
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy openai pyyaml python-dotenv


### OpenAI API key
This software requires your own OpenAI API key to be configured as an environment variable:

Windows users (from command prompt):
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here" (then reopen your terminal)

Linux users (from command prompt):
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here" (then reopen your terminal)


### Running the Software
1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Run the analyzer:
python squat_analyzer.py


### During Analysis
- The software will open a camera window showing your pose detection
- You have 15 seconds to perform your squat(s)
- Face your left side towards the camrera (right side does not work in this version)
- Black dots will appear on your joints (shoulder, hip, knee, ankle) when detected
- The system captures joint angles every other frame for analysis


### Getting Feedback
- After 15 seconds, the camera will close automatically
- The AI will analyze your movement and provide feedback
- Feedback includes:
  - Squat depth assessment
  - Torso positioning evaluation
  - Movement tempo analysis
  - Practical improvement tips
  - Overall score (4-10 scale)

## Controls
- ESC key: Exit the program early
- The program automatically stops after 15 seconds

## Troubleshooting
Camera not working?
- Check if your webcam is connected and not used by other applications

No pose detection?
- Ensure you're standing with your left side toward the camera
- Check lighting conditions
- Make sure your full body is visible in the frame

API errors?
- Verify your OpenAI API key is set correctly
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

## Tips for Best Results
- Wear contrasting clothing against your background
- Perform squats slowly and deliberately
- Keep your left side clearly visible to the camera
- Maintain good lighting throughout the session

## Output
The software provides bilingual feedback (Swedish and English) covering:
- What you're doing well
- Areas for improvement
